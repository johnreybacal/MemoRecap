					<p class="para1 ">You build up the conflict to a crisis point, where things just can't continue the way
					they are. A decision has to be made or some thing has to change. This point is called the
					story climax. If the story is a road map, this is the major fork in the road. The character
					can turn left and wind up in Alabama with her ex-lover or turn right and end up back
					in Illinois with her husband and kids.
